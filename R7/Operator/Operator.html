                <p>The Gemini Replicator is a remotely-controlled holographic copy of Iana. It can move and produces sound like she would, but it cannot shoot, melee or use secondary gadgets. It has a time limit, or it can be exited at any time. There is always a cooldown between two uses, which is longer if it’s destroyed. <br>
                The Replicator is all about fooling Iana’s opponents and collecting information. During its deployment, she can find her opponents and cause confusion to her heart’s content. If the Gemini is spotted and destroyed, it can help Iana deduce the threat’s location, but it will buy her opponents a few precious seconds to reposition.</p>

              <h1>BIOGRAPHY</h1><br>
              <h3>"All systems are complementary, if you know how to connect them.”</h3><br>
              <p>Meijer’s mother was lead engineer on the Huygens Atmospheric Structure Instrument that landed on Titan. Encouraged to reach for the stars from an early age, she studied Aerospace Engineering with a view toward becoming a fighter pilot. Unfortunately, her albinism meant she had compromised retina and her application was refused. She changed her focus to systems engineering, developing contact lenses that overcorrected her genetic deficit while integrating a state-of-the-art AR overlay.</p><br>
              <p>It was a collaboration during her doctorate that gave Meijer the first taste of where she longed to be. Returning from the International Space Station only fuelled her desire to explore the farthest reaches of the cosmos, no matter the cost. She pioneered topographical mapping software that allows her to project a real-time, virtual copy of herself to anywhere visible by satellite or drone. It was this technology which caught the eye of Elena “Mira” Álvarez, and subsequently Six.</p><br>
              <h1>PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORT</h1><br>
              <p>"The first time I met Specialist Nienke “Iana” Meijer she told me that the silver spoon I use to stir my tea has more in common with the nails that hold my chair together than the flatware of kings. She suggested a gold spoon for a less metallic aftertaste, but upon seeing me add sugar she amended it to zinc or copper. Marvellous. Her reductionist and frank approach is sure to challenge her fellow operators! […]</p><br>
              <p>Her face lights up when she tells the story of watching the landing on Titan with her mom, or of her precious few days on the International Space Station. It’s clear these events triggered a growing impatience to go further and see more. Had she been born 200 years earlier, she would have been one of the intrepid souls mapping every corner of our tiny blue marble, but as it is she’s had to settle for distant and less familiar worlds. […]</p><br>
              <p>Reading Meijer’s file, it’s apparent that she succeeds through sheer intellect, resolve, and fearlessness. Yet cocooned within her collaborative and outgoing exterior is a fragile core she keeps guarded and private. Growing up albino wasn’t an easy proposition, regardless of how outwardly tolerant society may seem. There was social stigma and childish name-calling, but these hardships fostered self-determination and self-assurance. Alone, she is a like a raging river: Hell-bent on overcoming any obstacle that blocks her way, regardless of the personal cost. […]</p><br>
              <p>She was eager to share her experiences and knowledge, and to grow within a very different sort of team than is her natural habitat. Especially thrilling is her ability to analyze a myriad of scenarios and to create discreet aspects of herself to tackle each of them simultaneously. Often, those who multitask have reduced outcomes in all areas, but here, also, Meijer is the exception. […]</p><br>
              <p>I have every confidence that she will make an excellent addition to Rainbow. However, much like Specialists Eliza “Ash” Cohen and Elena “Mira” Álvarez, it will be paramount to ensure that she synergizes with her team, rather than struggling alone to cross-purposes.</p><br>

                <p>The Remah Dash speed allows him to roam efficiently and cover short distances with unprecedented swiftness. It can also be used to knock down opponents and dash through breakable walls, creating a wide opening. Be careful of the cost, though, as he loses health every time the Remah Dash is used for breaching. <br>
                Additionally, Oryx has the unique ability to interact with broken hatches. He can climb straight through for a quick rotation, or he can hang on the edge to peek or wait for the perfect moment to go up. As long as he’s hanging, he can also opt to drop down if the climb seems too dangerous.</p>

              <h1>BIOGRAPHY</h1><br>
              <h3>“Sometimes, the only way out is through.”</h3><br>
              <p>Little is known about Al Hadid’s life. He grew up in a small town adjacent to an air force base, and by all accounts had a normal childhood up until he disappeared from international records for more than fifteen years. He eventually resurfaced in Jordan, but stayed only long enough to obtain a new passport. He learned wrestling in Istanbul, Muay Thai in Bangkok, tactical driving in Berlin, and precision marksmanship in Damascus, likely working for a paramilitary sponsor. Then he disappeared again.</p><br>
              <p>He next showed up as a cadet at Jalal “Kaid” El Fassi’s Fortress. As the years passed, his role evolved, from recruit to steward to instructor. Now the unofficial second-in-command, Al Hadid maintains the Fortress during Kaid’s absences and acts as a trusted advisor whenever the two of them are together.</p><br>
              <p>Rumors of Al Hadid’s ferocity abound, but remain uncorroborated by field reports and should be disregarded.</p><br>
              <h1>PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORT</h1><br>
              <p>Saif “Oryx” Al Hadid has lived an exceptional life. Torn from his family as a teenager, he was outside of Jordan – he won’t say where – when he was incarcerated. For over fifteen years he struggled for his freedom, moving between solitary confinement and different facilities. The rage he bears as a result of this inhumane treatment is something I have witnessed once, and hope to never see again. […]</p><br>
              <p>My first meeting with Al Hadid took place not in my own office, but in the well-appointed private sanctuary of Jalal “Kaid” El Fassi. He had told me stories of the warrior forged from raw iron, of his outstanding strength and resilience, but also of the weeks during which the man had sat, unmoving, in the scorching desert heat, waiting for Kaid to open the Fortress’ doors. […] Though no outward mark remains of his transformation, it is clear Al Hadid is a man thoroughly changed.</p><br>
              <p>We spoke of the ubiquitous cats of Morocco, of his trek, on foot, from Syria to the Atlas Mountains, and of poetry, for which he has a special fondness. […] Despite his scars, Al Hadid does not dwell in the past. There is nothing for him there, he said. I wondered if his stoicism hid some deeper longing, but in our sessions since I have found no such indication. […]</p><br>
              <p>Al Hadid’s phenomenal self-control puts my own efforts at mastery to shame. Even Specialist Yumiko “Hibana” Imagawa has commented on the utter calm he exudes. The difference between them is that he allows his control to waver at selected moments, in service of his larger goals. He has turned a crippling affliction into overwhelming strength. This is an extraordinary skill that I have encouraged him to share, when and where he will. […]</p><br>
              <p>Other operators are making inroads with Al Hadid, but progress is slow. I suspect, like many subjected to the depths of human cruelty, trusting others will not come naturally. Disquieting though it is to admit, Rainbow may be the one place where he is amongst those who can best understand his past.</p><br>

              <h3>“The closer you are to death, the more vibrant life becomes.”</h3><br>
              <p>Born to a fishing family on the coast of Kenya, Furaha spent his childhood hunting sharks and collecting lost treasures from the ocean floor of the Lamu Archipelago. It soon became apparent that he was able to stay underwater far longer than his peers, and medical exploration revealed an abnormal physiology that contributed to Furaha’s long-held belief that he was “not from here.” When the opportunity arose to join the Kenyan Navy, and later the Kenya Special Boat Unit, he put his skills to good use. He quickly drew the attention of generals within the navy as well as the worldwide scientific community for his prolific and frequent record-breaking freedives. He later transitioned to NIGHTHAVEN, drawn by the promise of more down-time and a private boat to take him to where his next dive site might be.</p><br>
              <h1>PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORT</h1><br>
              <p>Talking to Specialist Ngũgĩ Muchoki “Wamai” Furaha is like talking underwater. Words are exchanged, but it’s not certain that meaning follows. […] Surprisingly, I find myself refreshed by our exchanges. There’s a purity that comes with free association, with being able to jump from one abstract concept to the next. Furaha senses, too, when other people are likely to get lost – at the moments where I find myself most without an anchor, his quick smile and change of topic reassures me that we have not gone beyond all human thought, never to return. […] It makes me question whether I should be more flexible in my thought processes, followed quickly by wondering, if I were, who I would become. […]</p><br>
              <p>The existential questions raised by someone who spends their free time anoxic are not those we ask ourselves often. And, perhaps deprived of Furaha’s particular sensitivity to these topics, I’m not certain I see value in them. His unaccustomed approach results in strategies that are completely alien. Furaha’s ability to conceptualize 3D space in not just the horizontal but the vertical is something I’ve only seen in the most obsessive of pilots. Yet his internal dimension is surprisingly absent. […]</p><br>
              <p>I once spoke with a renowned monk who had spent his life in pursuit of “complete zero.” In him, I saw the same depth of being I see now in Furaha, but where many people’s spirituality serves to shore up those parts of their personality that they most admire, theirs is the inverse. Furaha’s life is in service to his spirituality. Anoxia is part of his addiction. […]</p><br>
              <p>In all of my consultations, I strive for neutrality. Furaha is a talented operator, capable, intelligent, and unpredictable. His ability to put a room at ease is invaluable. Yet one never has the sense that they hold the whole picture of him in their mind. Like the nitrogen that must disperse back into the diver’s body before resurfacing, Furaha’s true nature is diffuse. To define him would be to limit him, and I have the distinct sense that there is nothing he would despise more.</p><br>

            <h3>“Forget who you are, and nothing else matters. You’ll fight for anyone, and never know why.”</h3><br>
            <p>Specialist Azucena Rocío “Amaru” Quispe began her career as an anthropologist concerned with the preservation of Peru’s shared cultural heritage. Her unique familial link to colonial explorers of the early 20th century gave her uncommon insight into both how voyages of discovery can shape cultural consciousness, and into the deep and abiding loss created when a shared cultural touchstone is lost. She served for several years in the Policía Nacional del Perú (PNP), before reorienting as a freelance archeologist focussed on the discovery and categorisation of new archaeological sites. After several run-ins with antiquities traffickers, and failed attempts to bring them down from within, she turned to guerrilla tactics in order to seize important cultural discoveries for the Peruvian State. When Specialist César “Goyo” Ruiz Hernández made us aware of her presence, she had already spent some 20-odd years in the jungles of Peru, fighting the cartels on her own terms.</p><br>
            <h1>PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORT</h1><br>
            <p>Specialist Azucena Rocío “Amaru” Quispe’s self-awareness is uncanny, especially with regards to what motivates her. Loss is not unusual for an operator to face, but not often in such great numbers, nor in such quick succession. […]</p><br>
            <p>She learned early on to be at home in the jungle. Her family attachments were the grounding elements in a difficult childhood. While her siblings and cousins provided her with plenty of friendly rivalries, her grandmother’s quiet hope is what she speaks of most fondly. From what I understand, her great-grandfather disappeared almost a century ago on an expedition to a lost city – details suggest he traveled with Percy Fawcett, though confirmation is impossible – yet Quispe’s grandmother always believed her father would return. Even long after Kantuta’s death, I suspect Quispe still holds the same fairytale notion of an eventual reunion. […]</p><br>
            <p>Quispe’s strength lies in her uncommon mix of realism and good humor. She isn’t afraid to laugh at the curveballs life throws her, yet she has confessed to me that she feels “haunted” by the ongoing unrest in her home country. She is, first and foremost, possessed of a deep and abiding love for Peru. […] I would never accuse Quispe of being a sentimentalist, because her interest in preserving her culture is far more mercenary than most people would understand. […]</p><br>
            <p>The bond between Quispe and Specialist César “Goyo” Ruiz Hernández is clearly something they both treasure. I suspect she accepted the offer to join Rainbow simply to spend time with him, believing that she would be back in the Amazon before too long. What she seeks is more tools to add to her arsenal, but it’s what she has to teach that’s vital to the future of this unit. Without her, we will be hard-pressed to combat the very forces she has been evading for the past 20 years. […]</p><br>
            <p>In any case, her gregariousness has seen her quickly integrated with the other operators. It remains now only to convince her that this is where she can make the greatest difference, and that task falls to me.</p><br>

              <p>Like the ordinary Deployable Shield, the Volcán Shield provides cover and allows Defenders to block pathways, but Goyo turns up the heat with an attached incendiary bomb. From the front, however, there’s little indication of which it might be. Until someone shoots the bomb to make it explode, the shield continues to be an obstacle for the Attackers.</p>

            <h3>“A person is never more honest than when they think they’re alone.”</h3><br>
            <p>César Ruiz Hernández was eleven years old when a bomb destroyed his home, killing his father and sister and severely injuring his mother. With the help of Specialist Azucena Rocío “Amaru” Quispe, César’s mother Sofia taught him to observe his surroundings, and to avoid the other boys his age who had been drawn into gang-related affairs. She encouraged him to enroll at the Heroic Naval Military School, where he graduated as a teniente de corbeta. He joined the Naval Infantry, then the Amphibious Commando Battalion, participating extensively in anti-smuggling operations and several high-profile arrests. Becoming a member of the Fuerzas Especiales introduced him to the reality that drugs were no longer the primary source of income for the cartels. He began working with UNESCO and INTERPOL to combat antiquities trafficking, where he gained the attention of Rainbow as a mind with a keen tactical sense and exceptional forward-thinking.</p><br>
            <h1>PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORT</h1><br>
            <p>Specialist César "Goyo" Ruiz Hernández is a rare find. His jacket reads like any normal military trajectory, until you notice the devil behind the details. To confirm my theory, during our first meeting I challenged him to a game of chess. I won’t mention how few moves it took him to beat me. César himself seemed to think nothing of it. […]</p><br>
            <p>This humble attitude is at the heart of his character. His mother, Sofia – who protected him from the brunt of the bomb’s blast – has cultivated an overtly optimistic worldview. Growing up where he did, when he did, she also instilled in him a cat-and-mouse mindset, to keep him clear of the negative influences that would have been especially tempting to a young fatherless boy with too much time on his hands. She was helped in this by Specialist Azucena Rocío “Amaru” Quispe, whose intermittent presence and strong familial values shored up a gap that Sofia alone couldn’t fill. […] It’s clear to me that Quispe, with her inherent attachment to her country and her family history, provided a stabilizing influence during Hernández’s undoubtedly troubled adolescence. […]</p><br>
            <p>Hernández is the kind to think carefully before speaking, a trait which can lead people to underestimate him. He is neither churlish nor aloof, but constantly considering the many angles of the problem set before him. […] His ability to track and guide his quarry, from determining their routine to understanding how they will react to threats, is uncanny. In a prosaic example, he brought Specialist Tina Lin “Frost” Tsang a bottle of apple-flavored soda on the first day of Fall, despite them only having met once before. She was unperturbed, but I could see that Hernández had braced himself for a far less positive outcome. […]</p><br>
            <p>Specialist Hernández has otherwise become a staple of our briefings, his incisive questions highlighting new tactical considerations or encouraging out-of-the-box thinking from the other members of the team. I must admit, it’s refreshing to see what changes a new perspective and an impeccable poker face can bring to an otherwise very self-assured group of individuals.</p><br>
